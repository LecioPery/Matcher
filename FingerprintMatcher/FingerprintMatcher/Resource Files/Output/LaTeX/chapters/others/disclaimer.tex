\chapter{Disclaimer}
\indent If you expect self indulgence, I already did on .tex files I generated. Here, I have a relevant warning: each chapter represents a set of experiments.\\
\indent Due to that, inside the chapter you can find each experiment in a subsection where the false positive x false negative graphics for all its databases can be found, and the average between the databases.\\

\indent Finaly, the randomized vector and the graphic of each database performance \textbf{across} experiments marks the end of the chaper.\\
