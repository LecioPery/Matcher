\chapter{Motivations given by Lecio}
\section{Lazyness}
\indent I could lie to you and say it was just because nobody ever done before. No. That's a POSTUMOUS valid reason. It all started because my professor Zaghetto - peace be upon my prophet - asked me to do this stonemason work. I'd rather do the 3x harder thought task than the repetitive task of collecting all this data by hand and produce all these damn graphics.
\section{Scalability}
\indent Then, after doing it with some automation, he liked the results. He wanted more complex tasks and started making more complex plans. It was the last straw. As more stonemason work he added, as more I made machines to operate them. Why playing an instrument when you can make a robot to do the music for you?\\
\indent So automated ideas can be run more aggressively. I produced far more results with my lazyness than I would ever produce with my diligence, and I am not trying to sound edgy.\\

\indent I just don't understand why people keep asking me all the time if I am high. Everywhere. Even my sister. Even my \textbf{\textit{mother}}.
